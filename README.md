An Attempt to automate compliance preparedness for organizations using python

This is certainly an undertaking for the ages as this is no easy task. 

   1 Define the data model: The first step is to define the data model that will store the necessary data. This includes creating tables for policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities, assets, and incidents, and defining the relationships between them.

   2 Create a user interface: Once you have defined the data model, you can create a user interface that allows users to manage the data. You can use a web framework like Django or Flask to build a web-based interface that allows users to create, edit, and delete records.

   3 Define workflows: You will need to define workflows for each process, such as approvals, notifications, and escalations. You can use a workflow engine like Apache Airflow or Camunda to define and manage these workflows.

  4 Integrate with other systems: Your system will need to integrate with other software applications and systems, such as HR systems, procurement systems, and incident management systems. You can use APIs or webhooks to integrate with these systems.

   5 Generate reports and dashboards: Finally, you will need to generate reports and dashboards to monitor the effectiveness of the information security program and identify areas for improvement. You can use a reporting framework like JasperReports or Tableau to generate these reports and dashboards.

@abtzpro @AdamR @HelloSecurity created a basic boilerplate version of the required compliance preperation automation scripts. With a little customization, this methodology of compliance preperation automation could benefit many SMB and Enterprise organizations and help to save money where possible regarding compliance preparations.
